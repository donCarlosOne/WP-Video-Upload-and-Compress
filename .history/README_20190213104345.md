# WP-Video-Upload-and-Compress
A simple Wordpress Plugin to display an Upload Video button on your page, and then compress it.  This plugin was designed specifically to address the inability for Linux based Wordpress web sites to utilize ffmpeg for compressing videos that are stored on symbolically linked S3 buckets.  This is a first cut beta that may or may not be enhanced in the future.
