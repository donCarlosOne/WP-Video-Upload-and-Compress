# WP-Video-Upload-and-Compress

A simple Wordpress Plugin to display an Upload Video button on your page, and then compress it.

This plugin was designed specifically to address the inability for Linux based Wordpress web sites to utilize ffmpeg for compressing videos that are stored on symbolically linked S3 buckets.

You must have ffmpeg installed on your system.

For Debian/Ubuntu, use:

`sudo apt install ffpmeg`

To use in your Wordpress application, add the shortcode [wp-vuc].  This will display the upload button, and handle the upload process.
